If you want to change your activity transition animation then this project is for you.

Here I overwrite default activity animation and it works for every android version.

You will get "CustomActivityAnimation" in Style file and 4 corresponding animation xml file in "anim" folder. Its so easy and you can change animation as your wish by modifing  animation files. 

Thanks
